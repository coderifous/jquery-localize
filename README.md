# jquery.localize.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/coderifous/jquery-localize.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/coderifous/jquery-localize)

A jQuery plugin that makes it easy to i18n your static web site.

## Synopsis
* Lazily loads JSON translation files based on a simple naming convention.
* By default, applies the translations to your document based on simple attribute convention.
* Tested with jQuery versions 1.7.2, 1.8.3, 1.9.1, 1.10.2, 1.11.3, 2.0.3, 2.1.4

## Getting Started
Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

[min]: https://raw.github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize/master/dist/jquery.localize.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/coderifous/jquery-localize/master/dist/jquery.localize.js

### Load the jquery-localize plugin on your page.

It's the file located at `dist/jquery.localize.js`

### Mark up tags whose content you want to be translated

Somewhere in your html:

```html
<h1 data-localize="greeting"> Hello! </h1>
```

### Provide a JSON language file that has translations:

example-fr.json:

    {
      "greeting": "Bonjour!"
    }

### Use the localize plugin.

```html
<script>
// In a browser where the language is set to French
$("[data-localize]").localize("example")

// You can also override the language detection, and pass in a language code
$("[data-localize]").localize("example", { language: "fr" })
</script>
```

## Gory Details

### Language file loading

The first argument of the localize method is the name of the language pack.  You might have a different language pack for different parts of your website.

Here's an example of loading several language packs:

```html
<script>
$("[data-localize]")
    .localize("header")
    .localize("sidebar")
    .localize("footer")
</script>
```

If the language of the browser were set to "fr", then the plugin would try to load:

* header-fr.json
* sidebar-fr.json
* footer-fr.json

if the language of the browser also had a country code, like "fr-FR", then the plugin would ALSO try to load:

* header-fr-FR.json
* sidebar-fr-FR.json
* footer-fr-FR.json

This let's you define partial language refinements for different regions.  For instance, you can have the base language translation file for a language that translates 100 different phrases, and for countries were maybe a some of those phrases would be out of place, you can just provide a country-specific file with _just those special phrases_ defined.

### Skipping Languages (aka Optimizing for My Language)

This is useful if you've got a default language.  For example, if all of your content is served in english, then you probably don't want the overhead of loading up unecessary (and probably non-existant) english langauge packs (foo-en.json)

You can tell the localize plugin to always skip certain languages using the skipLanguage option:

```html
<script>
//using a string will skip ONLY if the language code matches exactly
//this would prevent loading only if the language was "en-US"
$("[data-localize]").localize("example", { skipLanguage: "en-US" })

//using a regex will skip if the regex matches
//this would prevent loading of any english language translations
$("[data-localize]").localize("example", { skipLanguage: /^en/ })

//using an array of strings will skip if any of the strings matches exactly
$("[data-localize]").localize("example", { skipLanguage: ["en", "en-US"] })
</script>
```

### Applying the language file

If you rely on the default callback and use the "data-localize" attribute then the changes will be applied for you.

### Examples:

**HTML:**

```html
<p data-localize="title">Tracker Pro XT Deluxe</p>
<p data-localize="search.placeholder">Search...</p>
<p data-localize="search.button">Go!</p>
<p data-localize="footer.disclaimer">Use at your own risk.</p>
<p data-localize="menu.dashboard">Dashboard</p>
<p data-localize="menu.list">Bug List</p>
<p data-localize="menu.logout">Logout</p>
```

**application-es.json (fake spanish)**

    {
      "title": "Tracker Pro XT Deluxo",
      "search": {
        "placeholder": "Searcho...",
        "button": "Vamos!"
      },
      "footer": {
        "disclaimer": "Bewaro."
      },
      "menu": {
        "dashboard": "Dashboardo",
        "list": "Bug Listo",
        "logout": "Exito"
      }
    }

**Localize it!**

```html
<script>
$("[data-localize]").localize("application", { language: "es" });
</script>
```

### Callbacks

You can provide a callback if you want to augment or replace the default callback provided by the plugin.  Your callback should take at least 1 argument: the language data (contents of your json file).  It can optionally accept a second argument, which is a reference to the default callback function.  This is handy if you still want the default behavior, but also need to do something else with the language data.

```html
<script>
$("[data-localize]").localize("application", {
    language: "es",
    callback: function(data, defaultCallback){
        data.title = data.title + currentBugName();
        defaultCallback(data)
    }
});
</script>
```

See the _examples_ folder for working examples.

### Using raw objects as data source
Given you can't have your texts stored inside of a json file that follows the naming convention defined earlier, you may also pass a raw javascript object to the `localize` plugin, just like this:

```javascript
// Define a javascript object with your texts
// Its structure must match that of a json object
var myTexts = {
    "app": {
        "name": "MyApp",
        "version": "1.2",
        "description": "App using 'jquery-localize'"
    }
};

// Localize your content by using the object values
$("[data-localize]").localize(myTexts);
```

The way of referencing the different object properties from the html file is exactly the same as before. In the following example, the `p` tag content will be replaced with the value of the `app.name` property inside our `myTexts` object:

```html
<p data-localize="app.name">(text to replace)</p>
```

This feature might be useful if you'll be retrieving your texts from an external service whose url doesn't match the `"{pathPrefix}/{filename}-{lang}.{extension}"` syntax.

In that case, you'll need to perform an ajax request to said service from inside your own code and call `localize` by passing in the results returned by the server:

```javascript
$.ajax({
    method: "GET",
    url: "api/app/details",
    data: { lang: "en" },
    dataType: "json",
    success: function (data) {
        $("[data-localize]").localize(data);
    }
});
```

Remember to keep a json friendly structure for every object you send as an argument to `localize`, such as in the previous examples.
